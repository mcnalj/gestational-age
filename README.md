Gestational age calculator for health care providers.

Gestational Age Calculator allows users to enter a variety of dates that the calculatore uses to calculate gestational age.

Users can enter:
  the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP)
  the conception date
  the gestational age in weeks and days
  the estimated delivery date (as EDD)
  
Conception date is calculated as 14 days before LMP.
EDD is calculated as 280 days after LMP.
Gestational Age is calculated from LMP to the Date entered in the first input field (Calculation Date, defaults to today's date).

Gestational Age Calculator is written in vanilla JavaScript and uses the Bootstrap 5 CSS framework.
